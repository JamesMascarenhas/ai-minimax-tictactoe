# ai-minimax-tictactoe

## Description
- This project is from HarvardX CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
- This program implements an AI using Minimax to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally

## Background
- Minimax is a kind of backtracking (recursive) algorithm that is used in decision making and
  game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent
  also plays optimally
- This algorithm works well with two player deterministic games such as tic-tac-    toe or chess
- It works by minimzing the possible loss for a worst case scenario
